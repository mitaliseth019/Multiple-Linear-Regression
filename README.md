## General Information
- Multiple Linear Regression model to to understand the demand for shared bikes for BoomBike
- understanding the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
These are 3 variables contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes
•	Temp = 0.548
•	Weathersit - Light Snow  =  -0.250
•	Yr = 0.230
